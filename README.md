# HexaKey #
#### An experimental USB Keyboard based on hexagonal keys ####

Recently I've noticed a few things about the keyboards used on standard computers:

1. The keyboard and key orientation seems optimal for typing with arms perpendicular to the computer keyboard. Because your arms approach the keyboard at about a 45 degree angle, you tend to compensate with your wrists, or adjust the way you type.
2. Human fingers are of different lengths. It's not as easy to move certain fingers to certain positions.
2. The keys on a computer keyboard are offset nearly 50%. A hexagonal layout, with 50% offset, would still likely feel pretty natural for typing.

Why do we have square keys, typically arrayed in straight lines across the keyboard?

Perhaps it's:

* Easier to manufacture
* What people are used to and have come to expect
* More comfortable than other keyboard formats

While some of these might be true, It's unlikely they are all true.

I'm working on a prototype design for a USB, Hexagonal Keyed Keyboard to test whether the idea is feasible, user friendly, and more comfortable for typing. I plan the following stages:

1. Design simple prototype keyboard with basic functionality
2. Test keyboard for comfort, ease of typing, and general design functionality.
3. If the design is worth continuing, improve any failures and deficiencies identified in step 2, and possble implement newly identified improvements to the design and function.
